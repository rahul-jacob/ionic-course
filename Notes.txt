- Issue One
	[ERROR] ng has unexpectedly closed (exit code 127).
  Resolution
	npm install @ionic/app-scripts@latest --save-dev

- Issue Two
	ionic : File C:\Users\erahu\AppData\Roaming\npm\ionic.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
	
	This could be due to the current user having an undefined ExecutionPolicy.

  Resolution
  	If you are using visual studio code:
    	1.Open terminal
    	2.Run the command: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
    	3.Then run the command protractor conf.js
	While doing step 1 & 2 i was able to start the ionic server by giving the command ionic serve and the app opened in http://localhost:8100
- Issue Three
	Cannot find module '@angular-devkit/build-angular/package.json'
  Resolution
	npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular

- Building angular appln to native app
	- ng build
	So when ever we are going to build a native app, we need to execute the ng build command. Because we are going to wrap our finished
	mobile app into a native mobile app.	

- Using ionic cli we add basically add android as a supportive platform in our project
	- ionic capacitor add android

Change the package index
	To change the package id, go to the file capacitor.config.json, there you provide a valid identifier to appId. Basically we provide
	the reverse url. This is basically used to differentiate app deployed in the store.

- After creating a new build using ng build, we need to execute the below command
	- ionic capacitor copy android
	because ionic capacitor, copies the www folder into the android folder (which is the native app) and bundle it into again.
	This command which should be executed each time when you do an ng build, because ionic capacitor copy android copy your www folder
	into the native app and bundle it again. This is a command you should run before you run the native app and see it. 
	- ionic capacitor run android
	What this command will do is it will execute all the previous steps for us essentially it will run
			- ng build
			- ionic capacitor add android
			- ionic capacitor copy android
			- Finally this will open the folder in android studio
	We also have the -l option run live i.e reload the android app in emulator each time when we do a change.
			ionic capacitor run android -l
- Running the App on a Real Android Device
You can easily run the app on a real Android device, too.
Simply connect your Android phone to your machine via USB and enable the "Developer Options" as described here:
https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options

Once enabled, check "USB Debugging" in the "Developer Options" and you're good to go and should be able to run the app on your device
by selecting it inside of Android Studio.

- Running the App on Android: https://ionicframework.com/docs/building/android

- Adding break points when executing from Emulator or Native Device
	In the chrome browser, type chrome://inspect then we can see the Ionic App and its running through an emulator. Below the Ionic App
	we have an inspect link. Click on the link. This should open up a new window where you can see the console logs and its not connected
	to your device.

						COMMON ISSUES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Issue One
	[ERROR] ng has unexpectedly closed (exit code 127).
  Resolution
	npm install @ionic/app-scripts@latest --save-dev

- Issue Two
	ionic : File C:\Users\erahu\AppData\Roaming\npm\ionic.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
	
	This could be due to the current user having an undefined ExecutionPolicy.

  Resolution
  	If you are using visual studio code:
    	1.Open terminal
    	2.Run the command: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
    	3.Then run the command protractor conf.js
	While doing step 1 & 2 i was able to start the ionic server by giving the command ionic serve and the app opened in http://localhost:8100
- Issue Three
	Cannot find module '@angular-devkit/build-angular/package.json'
  Resolution
	npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular
- Issue Four
	[error] Capacitor could not find the web assets directory "C:\Users\erahu\Documents\Learn\ionic demo\ionic-course\ionic-course\www".
    Please create it and make sure it has an index.html file. You can change
    the path of this directory in capacitor.config.json (webDir option).
    You may need to compile the web assets for your app (typically 'npm run build').
  Resolution
	This happens since we have not yet build the appln before. We need to execute the build command to resolve this Issue
		ng build
	So when ever we are going to build a native app, we need to execute the ng build command. Because we are going to wrap our finished
	mobile app into a native mobile app.
